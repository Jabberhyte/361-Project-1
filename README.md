This project is a day planner that multiple people can use to plan out days in the future.

Font Retrieval Microservice

This microservice is designed to query the api of google fonts for a given font and return a file.

The microservice will query based off a json titled "font.json".  An example format to retriece robotto would look like this:

{
    "apikey": "AIzaSyBdv7uflnwVg_D8IqMQw_CCc9ue5omXc90",
    "family": "Roboto",
    "style": "regular"
}

The data will be returned as a .ttf file in the same folder as the microservice program.

UML will come soon
